Questions to prompt the caller:

Describe the situation in as much detail as possible.
Where is this happening? At home, in school, in a workplace, in public etc.
Is the victim or the perpetrator a person known to you?
How many people are there?
Describe the people, are there any specific identifications?
Does the victim seem like they know the perpetrator? If yes, can you describe their relation? Are they family or do they seem like boss and subordinates etc.
Are there any stores, cars or security cameras nearby? Can you describe the surrounding 
Have you observed similar incidents in the same area?
Are you alone? Are there other people observing the situation? Are there people around that you can ask for help?
If yes, can you instigate the people around you? Can you get a group to approach the harassers?
Can you take a photo/video of what’s happening to submit as proof if it is serious enough to call the police? Make sure to get the victim’s consent afterwards for sharing this video with the required authorities.
Does the victim seem fully aware of the situation?
Is it possible for you to talk to the victim and ask them if they need help?
Is the situation getting violent? Can you approach people surrounding for help?
Are there authority figures/security that could intervene nearby?
How is the victim acknowledging the situation? Are they ignoring the perpetrator or responding to them?
Are there already people trying to disengage the situation? Do they need help?
Has the victim reported the incident to anyone (e.g., HR, manager, police)?
Has the victim experienced similar harassment before?
Does the victim want to pursue formal action (e.g., file a police report or a workplace complaint)?
Do you or the victim need immediate assistance (e.g., counseling, legal advice)?
Is the victim in danger of retaliation or further harassment?
Are you at threat from the perpetrator?
Does the victim want assistance in filling out the details for filing an official complaint?












Sometimes, a situation just does not feel right. It might be comments made by a friend that you feel are inappropriate or you spot someone being harassed at a party or club.
Being an active bystander means being aware of when someone’s behaviour is inappropriate or threatening and choosing to challenge it. If you do not feel comfortable doing this directly, then get someone to help you such as a friend or someone in authority.
Research shows that bystander intervention can be an effective way of stopping sexual assault before it happens, as bystanders play a key role in preventing, discouraging, and/or intervening when an act of violence has the potential to occur.
 
Before stepping in, try the ABC approach.
Assess for safety: If you see someone in trouble, ask yourself if you can help safely in any way. Remember, your personal safety is a priority – never put yourself at risk.
Be in a group: It’s safer to call out behaviour or intervene in a group. If this is not an option, report it to others who can act.
Care for the victim. Talk to the person who you think may need help. Ask them if they are OK.
 
How You Can Intervene Safely:
When it comes to intervening safely, remember the four Ds – direct, distract, delegate, delay.
Direct action
Call out negative behaviour, tell the person to stop or ask the victim if they are OK. Do this as a group if you can. Be polite. Don’t aggravate the situation - remain calm and state why something has offended you. Stick to exactly what has happened, don’t exaggerate.
Distract
Interrupt, start a conversation with the perpetrator to allow their potential target to move away or have friends intervene. Or come up with an idea to get the victim out of the situation – tell them they need to take a call, or you need to speak to them; any excuse to get them away to safety. Alternatively, try distracting, or redirecting the situation.
Delegate
If you are too embarrassed or shy to speak out, or you don’t feel safe to do so, get someone else to step in. Any decent venue has a zero tolerance policy on harassment, so the staff there will act.
Delay
If the situation is too dangerous to challenge then and there (such as there is the threat of violence or you are outnumbered) just walk away. Wait for the situation to pass then ask the victim later if they are OK. Or report it when it’s safe to do so – it’s never too late to act.


1. Introduction: The Importance of Bystanders
What is a Bystander?: A bystander is anyone who witnesses an event but is not directly involved in it. In the context of sexual harassment, bystanders are people who see or hear inappropriate behavior or actions but aren't the ones targeted.
Why Bystanders Matter: Bystanders play a crucial role in addressing and preventing sexual harassment. Their actions or inactions can either allow the harassment to continue or help stop it.

2. The Role of a Bystander in Sexual Harassment
Active Bystanders vs. Passive Bystanders:
Active Bystanders: Actively intervene when they witness sexual harassment or inappropriate behavior. They play a vital role in preventing further harm.
Passive Bystanders: Choose not to intervene or ignore the situation. Their inaction can perpetuate a toxic environment.
Power of Intervention: An active bystander can significantly influence the outcome of a harassment situation. Whether by confronting the harasser, supporting the victim, or reporting the incident, their actions can stop the harassment and make a person feel supported.

3. Why People Don’t Intervene (The Psychology of Bystanders)
Understanding the reasons behind why bystanders often don’t act is crucial for addressing the issue:
Diffusion of Responsibility: When multiple people are present, bystanders often feel less personal responsibility to intervene, thinking that someone else will take action. This is known as the bystander effect.
Fear of Retaliation: Many bystanders worry about the potential consequences for themselves, such as retaliation from the harasser, or being ostracized by others in the group or workplace.
Uncertainty: Bystanders may not know if the behavior they witness constitutes sexual harassment or if it’s appropriate to intervene. They may second-guess whether the victim wants help, or if it’s their place to get involved.
Social Conformity: People may fear standing out or being the only one to act in a situation where others are silent. Peer pressure or fear of disrupting the social order can prevent people from intervening.
Normalizing Behavior: In some environments, sexual harassment may be so normalized that bystanders don't recognize the behavior as problematic. This can happen in places where toxic attitudes toward gender or power are prevalent.

4. How to Be an Active Bystander in Sexual Harassment
To break the cycle of inaction, it's important for bystanders to take specific steps to intervene. Here are some key strategies:
Recognize the Harassment: The first step is identifying sexual harassment when it happens. This can include:
Inappropriate touching
Unwanted comments about someone's appearance
Sexual jokes or propositions
Harassing behavior or intimidation
It's essential that bystanders are aware of what constitutes harassment so they can act when necessary.
Assess the Situation: Before intervening, it’s important to assess the situation to determine the level of risk. If the environment feels unsafe, it might be best to seek support from others or call for help (security or authorities).
Decide to Intervene: Once a bystander recognizes harassment, they should decide whether or not to act. The options could include:
Direct Intervention: Confront the harasser directly and calmly, telling them their behavior is unacceptable.
Indirect Intervention: Intervene by supporting the person being harassed. For example, you could approach the victim afterward to check if they’re okay or ask if they need help.
Get Others Involved: Gather support from other bystanders, or seek help from someone in a position of authority, like a manager, teacher, or security personnel.
Offer Support to the Victim: Even if the bystander does not confront the harasser, they can offer emotional support to the person being targeted. This could include:
Checking in with the victim after the incident.
Asking them if they need help or reporting the harassment.
Reassuring them that what happened was not their fault.
Document the Incident: If it's not possible to intervene in the moment, another option is to discreetly document the harassment, if it’s safe to do so. This evidence can be helpful in reporting the incident later.

5. Barriers to Intervention
There are several factors that discourage people from stepping in when they witness sexual harassment:
Lack of Confidence: Bystanders may not feel confident in their ability to handle the situation. They may fear saying the wrong thing or making the situation worse.
Social Pressure: In social settings, bystanders may fear being judged by others or causing embarrassment. Social conformity can influence their choice to stay silent.
Lack of Clear Protocols: In some environments (like workplaces or public spaces), there might not be clear guidelines on how to address harassment. Bystanders may be uncertain about how to act or what is considered appropriate intervention.
Fear of Invalidation: Sometimes, bystanders worry that their actions may be misunderstood, and they may not be taken seriously. This can cause them to hesitate or refrain from intervening.

6. Overcoming the Barriers: Empowering Bystanders
For bystanders to become more effective, it’s crucial to address these barriers and create an environment where active intervention is encouraged and supported. Strategies to empower bystanders include:
Education and Awareness: Training programs and workshops that educate people on recognizing harassment, understanding their role as bystanders, and providing them with tools to act.
Clear Reporting Mechanisms: Organizations should create safe and clear channels for bystanders to report harassment. Knowing that their actions will be supported can encourage intervention.
Support from Leaders and Authorities: Leaders and authority figures (like managers, educators, or law enforcement) can help by creating a culture of accountability and by supporting active bystander behavior.
Encourage a Safe Environment: Creating a culture where people feel safe to speak out against inappropriate behavior is essential. This includes promoting mutual respect, gender equality, and addressing toxic power dynamics.

7. Long-Term Impact of Active Bystanders
Creating a Safer Environment: Active bystanders can help cultivate environments where harassment is not tolerated, and individuals feel empowered to speak out. Over time, this leads to fewer incidents of harassment and greater respect among community members.
Empowering Victims: When victims see bystanders intervene or offer support, they are more likely to feel validated and supported. This can reduce feelings of isolation and increase the likelihood that they will seek help in the future.
Changing Cultural Norms: Over time, bystanders who regularly intervene help shift cultural attitudes toward harassment. This creates an environment where inappropriate behavior is less likely to be tolerated, and people are more likely to speak up and take action when they witness harassment.

1. Acknowledge the Situation
Recognizing Harm: The first step in bystander intervention is realizing that something inappropriate or harmful is occurring. It could involve situations like:
Harassment (e.g., verbal abuse, inappropriate comments)
Bullying (e.g., physical or emotional intimidation)
Discrimination (e.g., racial, gender-based, or other biases)
Unsafe behavior (e.g., aggression or violence)
Trust Your Instincts: If you feel uncomfortable or witness behavior that doesn't seem right, acknowledge it. Your instinct to intervene often signals that something needs to be addressed.

2. Assess the Risk
Evaluating the Situation: Before taking any action, it's important to assess whether intervening could pose any danger.
Physical Safety: Is there a threat of violence or escalation? Are you or others at risk of harm by intervening?
Emotional Impact: Could intervening escalate the situation emotionally or make the person being targeted feel worse?
Context Matters: Consider the setting and who’s involved. Is this happening in a public space or more private setting? Is the aggressor someone with power or authority? Understanding the context will help you decide how best to proceed.

3. Decide Whether to Intervene
Assess Your Role: Ask yourself if you’re the best person to intervene, or if you should seek help from someone else. Sometimes, it's safer or more effective to call in an authority figure (security, manager, teacher, etc.).
Weighing Personal Risks: Are you prepared to deal with potential negative consequences? Will intervening put you at emotional or social risk? Think about your comfort level and readiness before acting.
Support is Key: If you feel unsure, don’t hesitate to seek out another bystander to help you, or even ask someone in a position of authority to step in.

4. Direct Intervention
Confront the Behavior: One of the most effective methods of bystander intervention is to directly confront the inappropriate behavior. You can:
Speak Up: Calmly but firmly ask the person responsible for the harm why they are acting that way or point out that their behavior is unacceptable.
Set Boundaries: For example, saying something like, "That’s not okay," or "Please stop, this is inappropriate."
Use "I" Statements: Instead of accusatory language (e.g., "You’re being racist"), use "I" statements to de-escalate: "I feel uncomfortable when I hear comments like that."
Ask Clarifying Questions: This approach can make the aggressor reflect on their actions and often diffuses tension. For example, you might ask, “What did you mean by that?” or “Do you think that’s appropriate?” It creates space for reflection without directly escalating the conflict.
Stay Calm: Emotional reactions like shouting or showing anger can escalate the situation. Instead, aim to maintain a calm and neutral tone.

5. Distraction
Interrupt the Situation: If you feel direct confrontation might make things worse, a subtle distraction can redirect attention away from the harmful behavior. Some examples include:
Changing the subject: “Oh, I just heard about this thing—did you know…?”
Engaging the person being targeted in another conversation: “Hey, I think I saw your friend over there! Let’s go talk to them.”
Redirecting attention to something neutral: “I think I just saw something important we should check out.”
Creating Space for Action: A distraction can give the person being targeted a chance to leave the situation or, at the very least, can break the harmful behavior’s flow long enough to defuse tension.

6. Delegate
Get Help from Others: You don’t have to intervene alone. Sometimes, involving others is the best option, especially if the situation is too overwhelming or dangerous for you to handle on your own.
Ask for Support: Look for other bystanders who might be willing to help. This might involve directly asking them to intervene or supporting them as they take action.
Involve Authorities: If the situation is escalating or involves illegal behavior (like physical violence or harassment), don't hesitate to contact security, police, or a supervisor.
Community Action: In cases where many people are witnessing harm, collective intervention is often more powerful. If multiple bystanders get involved, the harmful behavior may be less likely to continue.

7. Support the Victim
Check in After the Incident: Bystander intervention doesn't end with addressing the situation in the moment. After the event, it’s important to support the person who was targeted by:
Offering Emotional Support: Approach the person who was harmed and express solidarity. Acknowledge their feelings with statements like, “I saw what happened, and I’m really sorry you had to experience that.”
Listening Without Judgment: Give the person a chance to express how they feel. Don’t rush to offer solutions, just listen.
Empower Them: Encourage the person to take action if they feel comfortable, like reporting the incident or seeking further support. Let them know they have control over how they move forward.
Follow-Up: Re-check with them in the days or weeks that follow to see how they’re doing and if they need additional support. This shows continued care and ensures they don’t feel alone.

8. Use the "3D" Framework
This framework provides a helpful guide to remembering your options when intervening:
Direct: Address the situation head-on by confronting the harmful behavior.
Distract: Use a distraction to stop the behavior without directly confronting the person.
Delegate: Seek help from others, whether it’s fellow bystanders or authority figures, to handle the situation effectively.

Additional Key Concepts
Safety First: Prioritize the safety of both yourself and the individual being targeted. If it’s unsafe for you to intervene, look for alternative ways to get help (e.g., calling security or the police).
Be an Active Ally: Bystander intervention is not only about protecting individuals in the moment, but it’s also about creating a culture of care and accountability. By intervening, you contribute to making environments (workplaces, schools, public spaces) safer and more inclusive for everyone.
Changing the Social Norm: By stepping in when witnessing harmful behavior, you help shift societal norms around what is acceptable and unacceptable. This, in turn, discourages harmful behavior from happening in the first place.
Build Confidence: The more you practice these strategies, the more confident you will feel in future situations. Bystander intervention is a skill that improves with time and practice.

Conclusion
Being an ally through bystander intervention is crucial for creating a safer, more supportive society. It involves recognizing harmful behaviors, assessing the situation, and taking action in a thoughtful, calm, and effective way. By using strategies like direct confrontation, distraction, or delegation, you can make a significant difference in preventing harm and supporting those who are targeted. Ultimately, allyship is about standing up, speaking out, and fostering an environment where everyone feels safe and respected.
2. Key Elements of Intervention
Recognizing the Situation: It's essential for the bystander to recognize when help is needed. This includes identifying potential dangers or situations where someone may be at risk.
Assessing the Context: Bystanders need to evaluate whether it is safe for them to intervene. In some cases, direct intervention may not be feasible if it could escalate the situation.
Timing and Action: The moment of intervention is crucial. A timely response can prevent harm, while hesitation can worsen the situation.
Safety Considerations: Bystanders must prioritize their safety and that of others when deciding how and when to intervene.
3. Forms of Intervention
Direct Intervention: This involves confronting the perpetrator or assisting the victim directly. For example, speaking out, calling out the inappropriate behavior, or offering support to the victim.
Indirect Intervention: If direct intervention is too risky, bystanders can intervene by calling for help, notifying authorities, or seeking assistance from others.
Social Influence: Encouraging others in the vicinity to take action can be a powerful way to resolve the situation. Strength in numbers can deter perpetrators or offer more effective help.
4. Barriers to Intervention
Fear of Retaliation: Bystanders often refrain from intervening due to fear of personal harm, especially in violent or confrontational situations.
Diffusion of Responsibility: In group settings, people are less likely to intervene, assuming that someone else will take charge. This is known as the "bystander effect," where the presence of others makes individuals less likely to act.
Uncertainty and Ambiguity: Bystanders sometimes hesitate because they are unsure whether the situation is serious enough to warrant intervention or if it’s an appropriate moment to step in.
5. Benefits of Being an Active Bystander
Empowerment: When individuals intervene, it boosts their confidence and gives them a sense of responsibility and agency.
Social Responsibility: Being an active bystander contributes to the creation of safer environments by setting a positive example and preventing harm.
Creating a Culture of Intervention: Consistent intervention can inspire others to follow suit, leading to an overall societal shift where people feel more compelled to act.
6. Training and Raising Awareness
Education and Training Programs: The article underscores the importance of training workshops to help people become active bystanders. These include self-defense courses, conflict resolution strategies, and sessions on how to safely intervene in difficult situations.
Bystander Intervention Programs: Schools, colleges, and workplaces can organize workshops to teach people how to act when witnessing harassment, abuse, or violence.
Importance of Awareness: People must understand the need for intervention and how their actions can help prevent harm.
1. Initial Greeting and Confidentiality Assurance
Greeting: The helpline staff will likely start with a polite greeting, such as:
"Hello, thank you for calling Durga India’s helpline. How can I assist you today?"
Confidentiality: They may reassure the caller that their information and the conversation will be kept confidential and that they are in a safe space to discuss what they are going through.
"Please rest assured that this conversation is confidential. We are here to support you."
2. Assessing the Situation and Active Listening
The staff will listen carefully to the caller’s situation. This is an important part of the process because it allows the team to understand the nature of the problem—whether it's harassment, domestic violence, physical assault, or other forms of gender-based violence.
Example: "Can you please tell me what happened and what kind of support you need right now?"
Active Listening: They will engage in active listening, showing empathy and concern. The aim is to make the caller feel heard and supported, rather than rushed or dismissed.
"I’m really sorry you’re going through this. I’m here to help."
3. Assessing the Urgency of the Situation
Depending on the urgency of the situation, the helpline staff will assess whether immediate action is required.
Immediate Threat: If the caller is in immediate danger or facing physical harm, the helpline staff will likely direct the caller to the nearest police station or ask if they would like help in contacting emergency services.
"Is it safe for you to talk right now? Are you in immediate danger? We can help you contact the police or an emergency service if needed."
If the situation is not urgent but still serious, the staff will offer guidance and make appropriate referrals.
"It sounds like you're going through a very difficult time. We can connect you with legal support, counseling services, or shelters. Would you like us to help with that?"
4. Offering Resources and Support
The helpline operator will inform the caller about the range of support available, including legal assistance, emergency shelter, counseling, and self-defense training.
"We have trained counselors who can help you through this, and we also have legal aid services available. Would you like information about them?"
They will discuss the available safe spaces or shelters in the area, and may offer to connect the caller with these resources.
"If you feel unsafe at home, we can help you find a nearby shelter where you can stay temporarily. Would you like assistance with this?"
5. Providing Legal Information (If Applicable)
If the caller is seeking legal support or information on how to report the crime, the helpline operator will guide them through the process. They may provide information about FIR filing or how to seek a Protection Order under the Domestic Violence Act or any other relevant laws.
"If you would like, we can guide you through the process of filing a First Information Report (FIR) at the police station, or help you apply for a Protection Order."
6. Safety Planning (If Applicable)
In cases of ongoing domestic violence or harassment, the helpline may also engage in safety planning, helping the caller prepare an emergency response plan for situations where they feel unsafe.
"It’s important to have a safety plan. Do you have a trusted friend or family member you can call if you’re in immediate danger? We can help you plan ahead and make sure you know where to go for safety."
7. Referral to Further Support Services
If the caller needs long-term support, the helpline operator may refer them to partner organizations, shelters, or counselors. They may also offer to keep in contact to follow up on the caller's situation.
"I will provide you with contact details for a counselor who can help you navigate these challenges. Would you like me to send you these details via text or email?"
Follow-Up: The organization might set up a follow-up call or message to check on the caller’s well-being and offer ongoing assistance.
"We’ll follow up with you in a few days to see how you’re doing and if there’s any more support we can offer."
8. Encouraging Empowerment and Self-Advocacy
Throughout the call, the staff will encourage the caller to take steps toward their own empowerment, reassuring them that they are not alone in their fight against violence or harassment.
"You are strong for reaching out. It’s important to remember that there are people who care and want to help you. You don’t have to go through this by yourself."
9. Ending the Call with Reassurance
The operator will end the call by ensuring the caller has all the information they need and is not left feeling isolated or unsupported.
"Thank you for reaching out. Please remember, we are here whenever you need help. Don’t hesitate to call again if you need further assistance."

Additional Features of the Helpline Service
Multiple Languages: The helpline may operate in several local languages to accommodate a diverse population. This ensures that callers from various linguistic backgrounds can receive help.
24/7 Availability: In some cases, the helpline might be available 24/7, ensuring immediate support in case of emergency situations.
1. Recognize the Problem
Key Concept: The first step in effective bystander intervention is recognizing that a problem exists. This might sound simple, but many people fail to intervene because they don’t realize something is wrong or assume someone else will handle it.
Example: If you witness someone being harassed on the street, the first step is acknowledging that harassment is happening, rather than dismissing it or assuming it's not a big deal.
How to Do It:
Pay attention to non-verbal cues, like body language and facial expressions, that may indicate distress.
Trust your instincts—if something feels wrong, it’s often worth investigating or stepping in.
2. Understand the Power of Inaction
Key Concept: Snyder discusses the bystander effect, which is the psychological phenomenon where individuals are less likely to offer help when others are present. This is often due to diffusion of responsibility—people assume others will intervene.
Why It Matters: Understanding that inaction can perpetuate harm is critical. By doing nothing, bystanders enable harmful behaviors to continue unchecked.
How to Do It:
Recognize that even if there are others around, your involvement can make a significant difference. Don't wait for someone else to step up.
Reflect on how your inaction might affect the victim and your community.
3. Assess the Situation Carefully
Key Concept: Before taking action, bystanders should assess the situation to determine the level of danger involved and how best to intervene without escalating it. Effective intervention is about choosing the right approach based on the context.
Example: In situations of physical violence, direct confrontation may be dangerous. In cases of verbal harassment or bullying, using a non-confrontational method like distracting the perpetrator or providing support to the victim might be more effective.
How to Do It:
Quickly assess whether the situation is imminent (e.g., physical violence) or more subtle (e.g., emotional or psychological abuse).
Consider your own safety first. If you’re not in a position to directly intervene, consider indirect methods (like getting help from others, or calling for professional assistance).
4. Choose the Right Intervention Method
Key Concept: Snyder offers several types of interventions, depending on the situation:
Direct Intervention: Intervening directly by confronting the perpetrator or offering help to the victim.
Indirect Intervention: Helping from a distance, such as by calling the authorities or finding someone in a position of power to intervene.
Distraction: Creating a diversion to de-escalate the situation and allow the victim to escape or regroup.
Social Support: Encouraging others to get involved—sometimes, a group of bystanders can have a larger impact than a single individual.
How to Do It:
Direct Intervention: Be assertive but calm. If it's safe, you can approach the perpetrator and assert that their behavior is inappropriate. For example: "Hey, that's not okay, leave them alone."
Distraction: In a public setting, you can distract the person causing harm by interrupting the situation with a comment or action that shifts their focus. For example, you might ask a question, drop something, or engage the perpetrator in a different topic.
Calling for Help: In situations where it’s unsafe to intervene directly, calling police or contacting a nearby authority (like a teacher or manager) may be necessary.
5. Engage with the Victim Supportively
Key Concept: Often, bystanders forget to support the victim directly. After intervening, it’s important to make sure the victim is okay, offer them help, and show empathy.
Why It Matters: Victims of harassment, bullying, or violence often feel isolated and powerless. Having an active bystander express support can significantly impact their emotional well-being and their willingness to take further action.
How to Do It:
Check in with the victim after the situation. Ask if they are okay, offer them a safe space, or provide resources (like a helpline).
Validate their experience: Let them know that what happened was wrong and that they didn’t deserve it.
6. Develop a Community of Active Bystanders
Key Concept: Snyder emphasizes the importance of community in creating a culture of bystander intervention. When people work together, they can create a safer environment where harmful behavior is less likely to be tolerated.
Why It Matters: In a community where bystanders are regularly empowered to intervene, individuals are more likely to take action in future situations, which reduces the overall incidence of harm.
How to Do It:
Encourage open dialogue about bystanderism in your community or workplace. Hold workshops, discussions, or awareness campaigns to educate people about their role.
Support others who intervene—praise their actions and make them feel more confident in standing up for others.
7. Understand the Ethical and Legal Implications
Key Concept: Active bystandership often requires individuals to make ethical decisions about intervening, especially in situations where legal consequences or personal safety are involved. Snyder discusses the moral imperative to intervene but also the legal considerations that may affect how someone can act.
Why It Matters: It’s crucial to understand the legal framework surrounding intervention, especially in cases of physical assault, sexual harassment, or bullying.
How to Do It:
Familiarize yourself with local laws surrounding reporting and intervening in cases of harassment or assault. Knowing your rights and responsibilities can help you make informed decisions.
If you’re unsure how to act, seeking guidance from legal authorities or support organizations can clarify the safest course of action.
8. Foster Personal Growth and Courage
Key Concept: Being an active bystander is not always easy, and it can take courage to step up, especially in situations where you feel uncomfortable or unsure. Snyder encourages individuals to develop the courage to intervene, even if it feels daunting at first.
Why It Matters: By building personal confidence and self-efficacy, individuals can more easily become consistent and reliable bystanders in challenging situations.
How to Do It:
Practice self-reflection on situations where you could have intervened but didn’t, and think about how you could respond differently next time.
Work on developing a mindset that views intervention as an ethical responsibility, not just a choice.
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23489266_The_Responsive_Bystander_How_Social_Group_Membership_and_Group_Size_Can_Encourage_as_Well_as_Inhibit_Bystander_Intervention 
Sure! Here's a more detailed breakdown of the paper "The Responsive Bystander: How Social Group Membership and Group Size Can Encourage as Well as Inhibit Bystander Intervention" by John M. Latané and Bibb Latané.
Overview:
The paper explores the dynamics of bystander intervention, specifically how group membership and group size influence whether individuals decide to act in an emergency situation. It expands on previous theories, particularly the bystander effect, and offers a nuanced look at how social identity and group-related factors can both encourage and inhibit intervention.
1. The Bystander Effect:
The paper builds on the classic research on the bystander effect, which suggests that people are less likely to help in an emergency when others are present. This phenomenon was first described in the context of the Kitty Genovese case (1964), in which multiple witnesses failed to intervene as Genovese was attacked and murdered.
Key to the bystander effect is the concept of diffusion of responsibility: the more people there are around, the less each individual feels personally responsible for intervening. The presence of others tends to make people feel less accountable for helping, assuming that someone else will take action.
2. Role of Social Group Membership:
Latané and Latané’s paper emphasizes that group membership plays a central role in whether or not individuals intervene in a situation. The authors argue that group identity can influence an individual’s willingness to help others, particularly when the victim or the person needing help is seen as part of the same social group.
Ingroup vs. Outgroup Dynamics:
Ingroup: When the victim is perceived as a member of the same social group (ingroup), people are more likely to help. This is because people often feel a stronger sense of responsibility and empathy toward those who share their social identity (e.g., race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, gender, etc.).
Outgroup: If the victim is perceived as part of an outgroup (a group that the bystander does not identify with), the likelihood of intervention is reduced. This is because of social distance, biases, and stereotypes, where people are less motivated to help those they do not perceive as belonging to their own social circle.
For instance, in-group members might help because they view the victim as "one of us," which triggers a stronger emotional and moral response. On the other hand, when the victim belongs to an outgroup, the bystander may not feel the same level of empathy or moral obligation to intervene.
Social Identity Theory:
This is grounded in Social Identity Theory, which suggests that individuals categorize themselves and others into groups (ingroup vs. outgroup), and that ingroup favoritism can significantly affect behavior. The stronger the emotional or personal attachment to an ingroup, the more likely individuals will feel compelled to act in the interest of ingroup members.
3. Group Size and the Diffusion of Responsibility:
The paper re-examines the influence of group size on bystander behavior. The bystander effect becomes more pronounced as group size increases, because individuals feel a diminished sense of personal responsibility when there are many people around.
Smaller Groups: In smaller groups, the responsibility to intervene is felt more personally. When a person is in a smaller group (or alone), they may feel a greater moral obligation to act, as there are fewer people to "pass off" responsibility to.
Larger Groups: As the group size increases, each individual feels less accountable. If several others are present, each bystander may believe that someone else will take action. This leads to a reduction in intervention, as the responsibility is diffused across the group. People are more likely to wait for others to act, assuming that someone else will intervene.
4. Group Norms and Social Influence:
Another factor influencing bystander behavior is group norms—the expectations and behaviors that are shared within a group. In groups with strong norms that encourage helping behavior, bystanders are more likely to intervene.
Helping Norms: If the prevailing group norms encourage helping or intervention (e.g., a strong culture of social responsibility), people are more likely to act when an emergency occurs. Social influence in this context works in the form of peer pressure—if others in the group are likely to help, individuals may feel compelled to do the same.
Non-Helping Norms: Conversely, in groups where helping is not the norm, or if others are inactive, individuals may be discouraged from taking action. The presence of passive or non-intervening bystanders can reinforce the belief that intervention is unnecessary or inappropriate, leading to a conformity effect where people follow the behavior of others around them.
The authors suggest that bystanders may "look to others" for cues about how to behave, a concept rooted in social comparison theory. If others do not intervene, individuals may feel uncertain and inhibited from acting, as they assume intervention is unnecessary or would be socially awkward.
5. Factors That Encourage Bystander Intervention:
While the paper focuses on the barriers to intervention (such as group size and social identity dynamics), it also discusses factors that can encourage intervention.
Strong Ingroup Identification: People who strongly identify with a social group are more likely to intervene on behalf of a member of that group. If the emergency involves a fellow ingroup member, the bystander may feel a greater moral obligation to act.


Proximity and Personal Connection: The closer the relationship or perceived connection between the bystander and the victim, the more likely the bystander will intervene. This is especially true in small groups where personal relationships are stronger, and individual responsibility is heightened.


Clear and Unambiguous Emergencies: When an emergency is clear and unambiguous (e.g., someone is visibly injured or in immediate danger), the sense of responsibility to intervene may be more compelling, even in larger groups. This reduces ambiguity and increases the likelihood of intervention.


6. Implications for Interventions and Practical Applications:
The authors suggest that understanding the influence of group dynamics can help design interventions to encourage bystander intervention, particularly in larger or more complex group settings.
Training and Awareness Programs: Awareness programs could help individuals recognize their social biases and teach them how to respond effectively in emergencies. Training could also encourage bystanders to identify more strongly with the victim (perhaps by emphasizing shared human qualities or shared social identities) to reduce the effects of ingroup/outgroup bias.


Changing Group Norms: Changing group norms around helping and intervention can also be effective. By promoting pro-social norms (e.g., norms that encourage helping, such as those that exist in some organizational or community settings), people may feel more social pressure to intervene, even in large groups.


Empowering Individuals: Finally, empowering bystanders by making them feel personally responsible for the outcome can mitigate the effects of diffusion of responsibility. One way to do this might be to encourage people to directly ask others for help, thereby reducing the ambiguity of the situation and assigning specific responsibilities.


Conclusion:
Latané and Latané argue that bystander intervention is complex and influenced by a variety of social factors, not just individual attitudes or personality traits. Social group membership (ingroup vs. outgroup), group size, and group norms play crucial roles in determining whether or not someone will intervene in an emergency. These factors interact in ways that can both encourage and inhibit intervention. By understanding these dynamics, interventions can be tailored to foster pro-social behavior, reduce the bystander effect, and encourage more people to step in during critical situations.
In sum, the paper expands our understanding of the bystander effect by highlighting the importance of social identity and group dynamics, making it a valuable contribution to social psychology and practical applications related to emergency response and public intervention.

Sometimes called a “community of responsibility” approach, bystander intervention strategies create awareness regarding our active role in creating a safe and respectful environment by shifting community norms and behavior expectations. This research paper has outlined the potential application of new and creative bystander approaches to address sexual harassment in the workplace. The paper has demonstrated the potential for bystander approaches to make a real difference in preventing and addressing sexual harassment as costly and damaging workplace harm. The research paper has analysed the important role to be played by a bystander and intervention strategies to be adopted for combating sexual harassment in workplaces. Hglgt m Bystander intervention prevention strategy is a solution to the issue of sexual harassment. m It contributes towards creating awareness on sexual harassment. m It adopts innovative strategies to be an active bystander. Keywords: Bystander intervention, community of responsibility approach, sexual harassment Workplace sexual harassment is a persistent and pervasive problem not only in India but also elsewhere in the world, demanding new and creative responses (Burn, 2009; Koelsch, Brown, and Boisen, 2012). Many statutes around the world describe sexual harassment as conduct of a sexual nature that is unwanted or unwelcome and which has the purpose or effect of being intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive (Anderson and Whiston, 2005; Katz and Moore, 2013). Sexual harassment includes such unwelcome sexually determined behaviour as physical contact and advances, sexually coloured remarks, showing pornography and sexual demand, whether by words or actions (Kaithwas, 2017). Such conduct can be humiliating and may constitute a health and safety problem; it is discriminatory when the employer has reasonable grounds to believe that objection would disadvantage in connection with employment, including recruitment or promotion, or when it creates a hostile working environment (DeGue et al. 2014). 362 International Journal of Social Sciences: Vol. 10 • No. 4 • December 2021 Senapati One promising area which may inform prevention and response strategies is bystander approaches. In broad terms, bystander approaches focus on the ways in which individuals who are not the targets of the conduct can intervene in violence, harassment or other anti-social behaviour in order to prevent and reduce harm to others (Potter, 2016).The idea behind bystander intervention is simple: many of these harms or the precursors to them occur in the presence of other people, and these witnessing individuals thus have the ability to disrupt or mitigate these harms (Banyard, Moynihan, Plante 2007). Bystander intervention is the act of feeling empowered and equipped with the knowledge and skills to effectively assist in the prevention of sexual violence. Bystander intervention doesn’t have to jeopardize the safety of the bystander (Black 2017; Merrow 2017). Bystander intervention and “bystander education programs teach potential witnesses safe and positive ways that they can act to prevent or intervene when there is a risk for sexual violence (Banyard et al. 2018). Bystander intervention is when someone makes an attempt to help the person who is being harassed. This can range from confronting the harasser right there to consoling the victim and reassuring that what happened is not their fault (Campbell, 2008). This approach gives community members specific roles that they can use in preventing sexual violence, including naming and stopping situations that could lead to sexual violence before it happens, stepping in during an incident, and speaking out against ideas and behaviours that support sexual violence (Moynihan et al. 2015; Coker et al. 2011; Katz, 1995). The objective of the paper The research paper has intended to analyse the existing literature on bystander intervention strategy to extend awareness regarding the program. Who is a bystander? A bystander is a person who is present when an event takes place but isn’t directly involved. Bystanders might be present when sexual assault or abuse occurs—or they could witness the circumstances that led up to these crimes (Basile et al. 2016). An engaged bystander is someone who lives up to that responsibility by intervening before, during, or after a situation when they see or hear behaviours that threaten, harass, or otherwise encourage sexual violence (Ozaki, 2017). It may not be safe or effective to directly confront the harasser in every case, but there is a range of ways bystanders can be involved before, during, or after a situation when they see or hear behaviours that promote sexual violence (Espelageand Swearer, 2003). Bystanders are “individuals who observe violence or witness the conditions that perpetuate violence. They are not directly involved but have the choice to intervene, speak up, or do something about it.” “They are someone who is present and thus potentially in a position to discourage, prevent, or interrupt an incident.” They are people who have witnessed sexual harassment first-hand or got to know about it from the victim or someone who witnessed it (Espelage, Low, Polanin, and Brown, 2013; Olweus and Limber, 2010). This can be anyone who has not taken any action to prevent it (passive bystander) or someone who has intervened to either prevent it or reduce the harm (active bystander). “Someone who sees a situation but may or may not know what to do may think others will act or may be afraid to do something. “It is important to note that when sexual assault prevention educators talk about bystanders, they typically mean people who know each other, such as friends, classmates, colleagues, or members of sports teams (Olweus, Limber, and Breivik, 2019). The dynamics of bystander behaviour – and the impediments to action – are very different when people know the perpetrator or victim, versus when they are strangers.” Why bystander is necessary? The #MeToo movement has brought forth thousands of powerful stories illustrating the serious and widespread impact of sexual harassment and abuse (Banyard, Plante and Moynihan, 2004). The wave of stories and research has made clear that sexual violence is not limited to just a few abusers, industries, or populations of victims (Ricardo, Eads and Barker, 2011). Preventing sexual harassment is everybody’s responsibility. The behaviours that make up sexual violence exist on a spectrum. While International Journal of Social Sciences: Vol. 10 • No. 4 • December 2021	 363 Encourage, Support and Act: Bystander Intervention, A Solution to combat Sexual Harassment some behaviours – such as sexist jokes, inappropriate sexual comments, innuendos, catcalling, or vulgar gestures – aren’t illegal, this does not make them any less threatening or harmful to the person experiencing them (DeGue et al. 2014; Jouriles et al. 2018). These situations also take place across a range of locations and settings – often in public spaces, workplaces, schools, communities, and online. Bystander approaches may be useful in extending efforts to eradicate workplace sexual harassment and in the process, to raise awareness of the problem and change a culture of tolerance towards sexual harassment in organisational settings (Bronferbrenner 1977; Dahlberg and Krug 2002; Potter 2016). A focus on bystander interventions in workplace sexual harassment is important because targets of sexual harassment, despite significant negative consequences, often respond passively to the conduct – for example, by avoiding the harasser, minimising the behaviours or denying it altogether (Lisak and Miller, 2002; Lisak, 2011). This may be because although targets want the behaviour to end, they must balance this objective with avoiding reprisals by the harasser and maintaining their status and reputation in the work environment (Edwards et al. 2000). Research suggests that substantial proportions of employees, even a majority, directly or indirectly witness sexual harassment at work. In one Indian study, more than 70 per cent of women reported observing the sexual harassment of other women in their work environments (Gordon and Grubin, 2004). Furthermore, in this survey, nearly one in four respondents who had experienced sexual harassment had also witnessed sexual harassment. Employees are also frequently aware of who among their male coworkers harasses female employees and know when a harassment complaint has been made and is being investigated (Cohen and Felson, 1979). Another finding from the Commission’s prevalence survey suggested that sexual harassment may cluster in certain workplaces, with around 70 per cent of those who stated they had experienced sexual harassment also reporting that it occurred ‘commonly’ or ‘sometimes’ in their workplace (Darley and Latané, 1968). It is uncertain whether the co-occurrence was more related to a single perpetrator who harassed multiple targets, or alternatively, whether sexual harassment was perpetrated by multiple harassers in the same workplace (Hester and Lilley, 2014). The ‘clustering’ of sexual harassment in particular workplaces warrants further research attention, especially as it may offer a crucial vantage point from which to examine bystander approaches (Burn, 2009; Rigby & Johnson, 2005). However,difficulty in deciding how to react to the situation in facing the target of unwanted behaviour, feeling of embarrassment, fear of blame, societal allegation on personal character, centre of gossip, family’s respect, financial insecurity, lack of confidence, considering harassment as a normal behaviour in society, lack of evidences against the perpetrator etc. are some of the strong reasons that stand in front of a victim of sexual harassment to complain or even to share with others about the incidence. Bystander-Focused Prevention of Sexual Violence Research on the causes of sexual violence and evaluation of prevention efforts indicates that bystanders (also referred to as witnesses, defenders, or upstanders) are a key piece of prevention work (Powell, 2011). Research shows that bystander intervention can be an effective way of stopping sexual assault before it happens, as bystanders play a key role in preventing, discouraging, and/or intervening when an act of violence has the potential to occur. Components of bystander intervention  Awareness. A key first step is to heighten awareness so individuals and groups are better able to identify instances of sexual violence.  Sense of Responsibility. A sense of responsibility gives the bystander motivation to step in and take action. Bystanders are much more likely to help friends than strangers, and are more likely to help strangers if they see them as part of a group they identify with (like supporting the same sports team).  Perceptions of norms. Perceptions of peer norms about helping (whether you think your friends are likely to help), and perceptions of authorities’ (like teachers’) attitudes are related to bystander attitudes. People often mistakenly think others are less supportive of doing something to address sexual violence than they actually are. Studies show 364 International Journal of Social Sciences: Vol. 10 • No. 4 • December 2021 Senapati links between perceptions of helping, trust, and commitment among community members; trust in campus authorities; and their willingness to take action as a bystander.  Weighing pros and cons. People weigh the costs and benefits of getting involved in a risky situation. These include threats to their own safety, negative consequences for their relationships with others, and the potential to change the outcome of a risky situation or to help a victim.  Confidence. People who feel more confident in their ability to help are more likely to take action  Building Skills. People need to know what to do and how to do it. Population survey data shows that many people are at a loss for specific ways to help.  Survivors find that friends and family do not always do things that are useful or supportive, and these negative or unhelpful responses make coping with and recovering from abuse much harder.  Some of the promise of bystander intervention training is that it can give motivated community members skills to intervene in ways that protect their own safety and are truly supportive to victims.  Bystanders also need safety nets for themselves – resources they can call upon and community policies that support intervention. Intervention strategies to be adopted by a bystander Below are some intervention tips and strategies: (a) Distract This is a great way to stop a person from engaging in inappropriate behaviour. Examples of this include spilling a drink to create a distraction, walking up to the victim and saying that you need to speak with them for a minute before removing the victim from the situation, and changing the topic of the conversation. (b) Find Help Sometimes incidents are not something that a bystander can respond to alone. Many bystanders benefit by finding someone that can help out in a particular circumstance. For example, inappropriate behaviour may be occurring in a company email, text chain, or Slack channel. A supervisor may be able to intercede right away without the need for a bystander to intervene on their own. (c) Be Direct Walk up and directly ask the person to stop the behavior. Ending a situation by direct engagement can be done through a variety of phrases such as “I don’t find that funny. Tell me why that is funny to you.” Other phrases may include “That crossed the line” or “that is not appropriate.” This approach works best when the bystander can reference recent training that has been done. (d) Follow-up If a bystander cannot help immediately, then they should follow up with the perceived victim after the incident to see whether they need any help. The bystander should also report any incidents of sexual harassment in accordance with the company’s procedures. Perspectives of bystanders in confronting sexual harassment Studies suggest that a person who got to know about a harassment in his/her workplace experiences traumatic emotions similar to the ones experienced by the target (Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 2000; Koss, Gidycz, & Wisniewski, 1987). This is called “bystander stress”. However, another common phenomenon we all know about is the bystander effect. It is people’s tendencies to follow the cues of others when in a group. When a person sees no one reacting to a harassing behaviour, they tend to remain silent. This is generally because they may feel that they are the only ones feeling uncomfortable about the situation and they do not want to create a scene(Morrison, Hardison, Mathew, & O’Neil, 2004). These contradicting concepts of bystander stress and bystander effect show that people would like to intervene and stop a harasser, but it is the perceived peer pressure that acts as an obstacle. Not just that, even if someone is ready to step in, they don’t know when to and how to (Lonsway et al. 2009; Gidycz, Rich, & Marioni, 2002). Bystanders face many of the same obstacles to International Journal of Social Sciences: Vol. 10 • No. 4 • December 2021	 365 Encourage, Support and Act: Bystander Intervention, A Solution to combat Sexual Harassment reporting incidents and intervening in them as victims of harassment. Bystanders also face the psychological barrier that someone else will act to correct the problem and that the issue is not affecting them, so it is not their problem(Hickman, Jaycox, & Aronoff, 2004; Morrison et al. 2004; Cornelius & Resseguie, 2007). These are some of the reasons why the bystander effect, where multiple people witness an emergency or wrongful situation but do not act, is such a widespread phenomenon (Stueve et al. 2006). In fact, in many circumstances the more people that witness or are aware of inappropriate behaviour, the less likely it is that any individual will act to help the victim. There is a growing recognition that even observing or hearing about the sexual harassment of co-workers can foster bystander stress and other negative outcomes that parallel those experienced by the direct targets of harassment (Katz, Heisterkamp, & Fleming, 2011). Such outcomes include reduced health satisfaction, team conflict, declines in financial performance, occupational stress and job withdrawal. Studies of both sexual harassment and racial harassment reveal that employees who are victims of direct harassment and who are also aware of their coworkers’ harassment, suffer the equivalent of a ‘double whammy’, with negative occupational, psychological and health-related outcomes over and above the effects of their personal experiences (Banyard, 2011; Katz, Heisterkamp, & Fleming, 2011). It is important to note that observing or even perceiving men’s mistreatment of women affects not only targets themselves and other women, but also men. The self-interest perspective suggests that men may show declines in well-being because they are afraid of being personally blamed or concerned that they will be perceived as offensive or harassing (Schwartz & DeKeseredy, 2000; Reyes, Foshee, Niolon, Reidy, & Hall, 2016). The genuine concern view suggests that men may feel empathy or compassion when they observe or hear about the mistreatment of a close female colleague. This would be consistent with a more general explanation of bystander stress which suggests that hearing about negative events provokes distress through an ‘other-oriented’ emotional response, diffusing among individuals occupying the same environment, harassment, pinups and sex discrimination and ensured that programs on sexism and sexual harassment were run (Banyard, 2011; Edwards, 2012). Recently, thousands of schools, college campuses, military bases, workplaces, and other institutions have implemented bystander intervention training programs. These programs are meant to address and prevent social harms like bullying, sexual misconduct, and harassment. They typically take the form of a workshop or series of workshops that teach participants techniques and strategies they can employ if they witness harms occurring, sense that harms are becoming at risk of occurring, or are later told about such harms (Berkowitz, 2010). Steps of Bystander Intervention Bystander intervention can be broken down into five steps: 1. Notice What is happening that may require we to intervene? Is an employee inappropriately touching another employee? Is someone being bullied or harassed based on their sex? Is someone telling an inappropriate joke? 2. Identify the Problem What is the inappropriate behaviour? If an employee is asking another employee out (and not for the umpteenth time), then it may not be a problem. Employees should try to notice social cues. What are the people doing in the situation? Does anyone appear uncomfortable? 3. Assume Responsibility Acting and taking a stand is uncomfortable but necessary. The only way to change in the workplace and improve the culture is for everyone to assume responsibility for making the workplace better. 4. Determine the Appropriate Action Reviewing the situation and determining how to help is most important implementational step as in intervention. Sometimes the individuals separate before you are able to intervene. Bystanders may need to speak with the perceived victim to lend support or say that what happened was not right. 366 International Journal of Social Sciences: Vol. 10 • No. 4 • December 2021 Senapati 5. Act There are a number of different ways that people can react to resolve the problems presented. Some of the best ways that employees can call out inappropriate behaviour is through the following actions. The right action depends on the circumstances. Favourable results in adopting bystander intervention strategy Bystander intervention has been shown to be an effective and important prevention strategy to decrease rape myths, increase pro-social bystander behaviour and increase self-efficacy. Bystander intervention approaches seek to address the “bystander effect” phenomenon by demonstrating how bystanders can be effective in the primary prevention of interpersonal violence(Edwards et al. 2019). Bystander intervention gives responsibility to all members of a community to help ensure the safety of all members within that community. The goal of bystander intervention is to change passive bystanders into active bystanders who feel confident in their ability to “discourage, prevent, or interrupt” a sexual violence incident (Coker et al. 2017). Bystander intervention helps grant people the self-efficacy to stand up and speak up when a person is being harassed, or to support a family member when confronting an abusive relative. end sexual violence in comparison to the control group. Bystander intervention approaches help people recognize healthy and unhealthy behaviours that could potentially lead to sexual violence and how they could effectively intervene before the negative behaviour escalates. Bystander intervention can play a significant role in a comprehensive approach to sexual violence prevention (Basile et al. 2016; Niolon et al. 2017). It discourages victim-blaming and makes sexual violence a community problem, rather than an individual problem. This intervention can play a significant role in a comprehensive approach to sexual violence prevention. The intervention plays a role in helping to change social and community norms. Theoretical models-based Bystander intervention Bystanders are more likely to “engage in pro-social behaviour” when they are aware that there is a problem and they see themselves as a responsible party in solving the problem. This theory is demonstrated by the situational model, developed by Latane and Darley (1970), which is the most commonly used bystander intervention model. The model outlines the following five steps: (1) Recognize signs that an act of sexual violence may occur or is occurring. (2) Identify that the potential victim is at risk and that intervention is appropriate. (3) Decide whether or not to take responsibility to intervene. (4) Decide the most appropriate and safest way to intervene. (5) Implement the decision to intervene safely to diffuse the situation. Bystander intervention works at multiple levels of the Social-Ecological Model. The Social-Ecological Model addresses the multifaceted interaction between individual, relationship, communities, and societal factors that influence all perpetrators, victims and bystanders of sexual violence (Latané & Darley, 1970).  On the individual level, certain factors will determine whether or not a bystander is active or passive, depending on his/her own knowledge, skills and self-efficacy.  On a relationship level, a bystander may be more likely to intervene if he/she has a supportive social circle.  On a community level, bystanders may be more likely to intervene if the school, church or other social environment encourages intervention.  On the societal level, bystander intervention can begin to change social norms and expectations about what is considered acceptable behaviour in society. Conlusion The only way to make the workplace a safe place where people can work without fear of harassment is by acting. Acting to prevent harassment and responding to it when it occurs is a critical part of the process of improving the workplace. Everyone has a role to play in ensuring a safe and welcoming environment for all employees. Bystander intervention represents the next wave in attempting to prevent and address these harms, but social problems have been notoriously difficult to combat.

Disrupt the situation. Every situation is different, and there is no one way to respond. When you witness a person being harassed, threatened, or followed by someone, you can try to distract the harasser or insert yourself into their interaction to help the targeted person get out of the situation. For example, if you see someone on the street being verbally harassed, you can interrupt the harasser and ask them for directions. You can also intervene by pretending to know the person being harassed and starting a conversation with them as an opportunity to come between them and the harasser. Don’t act alone. Get support from people around you by calling on others to help. The more people who come together to interrupt a situation, the more you reinforce the idea that the behavior is not acceptable in your community. This can be as simple as saying, “Let’s say something to them so they stop.” If you do not feel safe, you may consider contacting the police. Confront the harasser. Whether or not you know the harasser, you can intervene by telling them in a respectful, direct, and honest way that their words or actions are not okay. For example, when you hear someone make comments that blame victims for being assaulted, or make light of sexual violence, you can tell them: • You need to stop. • That’s so inappropriate. • What you just said made me feel uncomfortable. Here’s why… • Do you realize how problematic that is? • We need to talk about what you just said. • Why would you say that? Set the expectation to speak up and step in. Talking openly and responding directly to inappropriate behaviors will have a snowball effect and encourage others to respond. It shows you recognize the comment or behavior is unacceptable and shows others it will not be tolerated. For example, if you are in a group setting and you hear someone make inappropriate comments, you can say: • Are you hearing what I am hearing? • I can’t be the only one who thinks this is not OK. • I don’t see how XYZ is relevant or appropriate to this discussion. • I know you’re a better person than that. Understand how your privilege positions you to speak up. Your age, race, gender, etc. may make it safer for you to speak up and be vocal about harassment – especially when you are not the target or representative of the target group. Focus on the needs and experience of the target and ensure they receive the support the need. • Let them know that what has happened to them isn’t their fault. • Affirm that they didn’t do anything wrong. • Express your support for the individual. – I saw what they just did. Are you OK? – I heard what that person said to you. I am so sorry. Take action online. Everyone can help address an online culture that tolerates rape and sexual violence. Online comments that blame victims contribute to a broader climate in which sexual violence is tolerated and not taken seriously. • Believe and support survivors. For example, thank survivors for sharing their stories in the comments of news articles and blog posts. • Respond to victim-blaming, rape jokes, or other problematic comments on social media: – Post a response like, “Sexual assault is never the survivor’s fault.” – Refocus accountability on the individual(s) who committed sexual abuse. • Link to an educational resource about sexual violence prevention, like those that can be found at nsvrc.org/publications. Be proactive. Practice with friends and family what you would say and how you would say it if you’re ever put in the situation where you need to confront a harasser. Think of how you would like others to take action on your behalf, or reflect on a situation where you wish you had acted differently

Use ‘I’ Statements: 
Change the focus to yourself: 1) State your feelings, 2) Name the behaviour, 3) State how you want the person to respond. This avoids criticising the other person, for example:
“I don’t like racist jokes. Please don’t make them anymore.”
“I didn’t like what you said about those women. Don’t say that anymore.”
“I don’t want you to make personal comments about my body. I’m here to support your learning.”
Silent stare/ body language: 
You don’t have to speak to communicate. Sometimes a disapproving look or not smiling at a ‘joke’ can be far more powerful than words.
Use social norms: 
Identify that this is not usual or accepted behaviour, for example
“Most people I know don’t think it’s OK to….” or “People just don’t say that kind of thing anymore…”
Group intervention: 
There is safety and power in numbers.
Best used with someone who has a clear pattern of inappropriate behaviour where many examples can be presented as evidence of their problem, either to them or a senior colleague/staff member.
Bring it home: 
Engage empathy with the person behaving inappropriately, for example
“I hope no one ever talks about you like that” or “How would you feel if someone did that to you/your sister/your daughter?” or “I wonder if you realise how that comes across?”
Call on friendship:
Reframe the intervention as caring, for example
“Alex, as your friend, I’ve got to tell you that lots of people don’t like your jokes about XYZ; it annoys them” or “I know that you would not want to offend someone but using that word is not great’.
Distract:
Snap someone out of their “comfort zone”, for example, ask a person being harassed in the street for directions or the time.
Remember: the Golden Rule is only intervene if it is safe to do so
Know your limits as an active bystander and engage others as necessary or if you do not feel confident about doing it alone.
Conduct conversations in a safe environment for you/the person you are speaking to.
